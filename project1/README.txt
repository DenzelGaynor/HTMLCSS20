Project 1—Media Queries
The goal for this project is to understand more about CSS media queries, 
and how they can help us ensure that the screen the user is using to view our website is presenting the websites we create in the best way possible.

In this project, you’ll make a website that contains media queries. 
The website that you create will notify the user in an obvious manner that certain media query breakpoints have been reached when the browser window is resized.
