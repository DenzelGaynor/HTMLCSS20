When the browser window reaches a certain width, you’ll see the layout like in the picture on the left. Where the “section” is on top of the “article,” but the “aside” is to the right of both the “section” and the “article.”

Once this width is reached, all of the elements will be stacked on top of each other.

For example: when your web browser reaches a certain width, all of the elements will be stacked on top of each other in this order: header, nav, section, article, aside, and footer.
