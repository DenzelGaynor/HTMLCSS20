The goal for this project is to pick out concepts found in two different websites. Combine these concepts into one website into your own.

Maybe you like a website’s overall design; or maybe you like the way certain text is presented to the user; or maybe, you like a certain color scheme; or maybe you like the way a website’s images are presented; maybe you believe that you can present what’s there in a more pleasing way? Whatever you’re attracted to from these two websites — combine them into your own spectacular website.

Here are the two websites in question:

http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/index.html and
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence
